WebAPISampleExam
================
This is one of my projects I am working and practicing on. It is the back-end part of a forum. In the repository you can find the asignment from Telerik Academy (A .docx file).
The time working on the project proved to be invaluable practice. Considering the nature of the whole project I doubt that it's perfect, but then again it's purpose is to provide a good learning and testing ground.
I've used Entity Framework and Web API. You are welcome to contact me to ask questions or criticize me or give me tips. I am still mastering Web API and I would gladly accept any feedback or provide some if I am able.
