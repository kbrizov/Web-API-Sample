WebAPISampleExam
================
This is one of my projects I am working and practicing on. It is the back-end part of a forum. In the repository you can find the asignment from Telerik Academy (Web-Services-Exam-aug-2013.doc).
The time working on the project proved to be invaluable practice. Considering the nature of the whole project I doubt that it's perfect, but then again it's purpose is to provide a good learning and testing ground.
I've used Entity Framework and Web API. You are welcome to contact me to ask questions, criticize me or give me tips. I am still mastering Web API and I would gladly accept any feedback or provide some if I am able.
