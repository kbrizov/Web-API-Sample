Web APi Sample
================
This is one of my old projects that I used to practice on. It is the back-end part of a forum. 
The time working on the project proved to be invaluable practice. Considering the nature of the whole project it's far from perfect, but then again it's purpose was to provide a good learning experience. It uses Entity Framework and ASP.NET Web API. 

EDIT:
This project is old. I always try to follow best practices when I code so it's valid to say that I did the best I could back in the days when I worked on this project. As the original README file suggests it's not perfect, but it still can be used as a reference point for some concepts and that is the main reason I decided to keep this repository although I consider it to be obsolete. I believe I can rewrite it a lot better now that I have accumulated more years of experience. However I don't think it's worth the effort so it will remain frozen for all eternity :D.
